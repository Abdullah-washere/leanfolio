# Spotfolio

A portfolio template built with Next.js that uses the Spotify Web API to let you optionally showcase your music preferences. This repo was forked from the Cleanfolio repo which you can find [here](https://github.com/rajshekhar26/cleanfolio).

## Differences between Spotfolio and Cleanfolio

- Spotfolio uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework which lets you take advantage of [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) among other features. API routes allow you to build both the site's front-end and its API with the same framework and deploy them to the same environment, e.g., [Vercel](https://vercel.com). This means that, if you want to, you can expand Spotfolio's API to your liking with minimal overhead.

- Spotfolio integrates with the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) by default to let you **optionally** showcase the track you're currently listening to and/or your top tracks. Explicit tracks are hidden by default but this can be changed.

- Spotfolio integrates with Google Analytics by default to let you **optionally** track visitor activity on your portfolio.

- Bonus:
  - Improved README documentation
  - Improved user interface

## Usage

### Running Locally

npm

```shell
git clone https://github.com/magic-ike/spotfolio.git
cd spotfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

yarn

```shell
git clone https://github.com/magic-ike/spotfolio.git
cd spotfolio
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Making Changes

- Go to `data/portfolio.js` and replace the dummy data with your own.

- To add a favicon to your site, put your `favicon.ico` file directly in the `public` folder.

- To add new API routes, refer to the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) linked above.

### Spotify (Optional)

To get the Spotify data to populate locally, you'll first need to create a `.env.local` file in your root directory to store some environment variables. Create the file and paste in the following code:

```shell
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=$CLIENT_SECRET
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=$REFRESH_TOKEN
```

To get the Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token, you'll need to do the following:

- Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and log in.

- Click **Create an App**.

- Fill out the name and description and click **Create**.

- Click **Show Client Secret**.

- You should now see the Client ID and Client Secret. Save these for later.

- Click **Edit Settings**.

- Add `http://localhost:3000` as a redirect URI and click **Save**.

- Navigate to the following URL in your browser (replace `$CLIENT_ID` with your actual Client ID):

```shell
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20user-top-read
```

- After authorizing, you should be redirected to your redirect URI. In the URL, there should be a **very long** `code` query parameter like so:

> http://localhost:8080?code=**NApCCg..BkWtQ**

- This is your Authorization Code. Save it for later.

- Now we're ready to get the Refresh Token. Run the following cURL command in your terminal (replace `$CLIENT_ID`, `$CLIENT_SECRET`, and `$CODE` with your actual Client ID, Client Secret, and Authorization Code respectively)

```shell
curl -d client_id=$CLIENT_ID -d client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=$CODE -d redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000 https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
```

- You should get the following JSON response:

```shell
{
    "access_token": "$ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "user-read-currently-playing user-top-read"
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "$REFRESH_TOKEN",
}
```

- Save `$REFRESH_TOKEN` as this is your Refresh Token. This token will last indefinitely unless you revoke access.

- After running the last command, you may instead get the following output:

```shell
{
    "error": "invalid_grant",
    "error_description": "Authorization code expired"
}
```

- In that case, just repeat the step where you navigate to the `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize...` URL in your browser, then repeat the steps after that.

- If everything went smoothly, you should now have the Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token. Plug those 3 credentials into the `.env.local` file and you should be good to go. If your local server was already running, restart it so your changes can be reflected.

### Google Analytics (Optional)

To add Google Analytics tracking to your portfolio locally, you'll need to add a new variable to the `.env.local` file you created in the Spotify section (if you skipped that section, just create a `.env.local` file in your root directory). Paste in the following code:

```shell
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_ID=$MEASUREMENT_ID
```

- To get the Measurement ID, [set up a new Google Analytics property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153), then set up a **Web** data stream for that property and copy the Measurement ID you see after setup.

- In the `.env.local` file, replace `$MEASUREMENT_ID` with the actual Measurement ID. If your local server was already running, restart it so your changes can be reflected.

### Deployment

- Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and sign up for an account if necessary.

- Click **New Project**.

- Import your repository. This should take you to the project configuration screen.

- **(Optional - Spotify)** If you want your Spotify data to populate on your live portfolio, you'll need to grab the environment variables you added to your local environment and add them to this environment. Expand the **Environment Variables** dropdown and add the following name-value pairs:

| NAME                  | VALUE (WILL BE ENCRYPTED) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID     | Your Client ID            |
| SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET | Your Client Secret        |
| SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN | Your Refresh Token        |

- **(Optional - Google Analytics)** If you want to add Google Analytics tracking to your live portfolio, the same process applies as with the Spotify data except you'll be adding the following name-value pair:

| NAME                            | VALUE (WILL BE ENCRYPTED) |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_ID | Your Measurement ID       |

- Click **Deploy**.

- If everything went smoothly, your portfolio should now be live. Congrats! ðŸŽ‰
